/**
 * Bitwise logical AND
 * 
 * Instruction example
 * 0101 DR  SR1 0 00 SR2
 * 0101 DR  SR2 1 imm5
 * 
 * f bit [5] is 0, the second source operand is obtained from SR2. If bit [5] is 1,
 * the second source operand is obtained by sign-extending the imm5 field to 16
 * bits. In either case, the second source operand and the contents of SR1 are 
 * bit-wise ANDed, and the result stored in DR. The condition codes are set, based on
 * whether the binary value produced, taken as a 2â€™s complement integer,
 * is negative,zero, or positive.
